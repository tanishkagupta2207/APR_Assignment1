This project builds a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the RMS Titanic. The analysis is based on the classic Kaggle dataset, "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster."

üìñ Introduction
The goal of this project is to apply fundamental machine learning concepts to a real-world dataset. We use passenger data‚Äîsuch as age, gender, and socio-economic class‚Äîto train a model that can classify whether a passenger survived the shipwreck. Logistic regression was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness as a baseline model for binary classification.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Exploration & Visualization:

Loaded the dataset and inspected its features (Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, etc.).

Identified and quantified missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.

Visualized key relationships, confirming that gender and passenger class were strong indicators of survival.

Data Preprocessing:

Imputed Missing Values: Filled missing Age data with the median age corresponding to the passenger's class (Pclass).

Dropped Unnecessary Columns: Removed Cabin (too many missing values), Ticket, and Name as they do not provide predictive value.

Encoded Categorical Features: Converted Sex and Embarked columns into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

Model Training:

The data was split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.

A LogisticRegression model from scikit-learn was instantiated and trained on the preprocessed training data.

üìä Results
The model's performance was evaluated on the unseen test set, yielding the following results:

Overall Accuracy: 82%

Confusion Matrix
The model correctly identified 91 non-survivors and 55 survivors in the test set.

              Predicted
             | 0  | 1  |

Actual   | 0 | 91 | 14 |
         | 1 | 19 | 55 |
-------------------------

üöÄ Potential Improvements
The current model serves as a strong baseline. Future work could include:

Feature Engineering: Creating new features like FamilySize (from SibSp + Parch) or IsAlone.

Advanced Imputation: Using more sophisticated techniques (e.g., KNN imputer) for missing Age values.

Alternative Models: Experimenting with more complex algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines to potentially improve accuracy.
